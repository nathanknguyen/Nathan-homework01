# Homework 1: HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
This assignment is about HTML semantics and CSS refactoring. We had to rename the <div> tags so that it would make more sense to read. Then we had to reflect those changes in the style.css file. Along the way, we had to use bash commands to add, commit, and push our changes to the github repository.
